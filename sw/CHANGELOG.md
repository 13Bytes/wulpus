## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- A new web-based UI application (`wulpus-frontend/`, Vite + React) with panels for connection, TX/RX config, ultrasound config, logs, and live graphing.
  It has feature-pairity with the jupyter notebook gui.
- A new FastAPI backend service (`wulpus/`) exposing HTTP APIs and a WebSocket stream for live measurements; includes config and log endpoints.
- Recording functionality and compressed logging that includes the recording start timestamp.
- Mocked dongle, simulation, and replay modes to ease development and demonstrations.
- User-defined graph filter, fullscreen mode for the graph
- Configuration persistence across reloads via localStorage.

### Changed

- Moved the existing Gui from `/sw/wulpus` into `/sw/jupyter notebook (legacy)/wulpus_jptnbk`.
- Frontend is now served by the FastAPI backend.
- Refactored US acquisition setup; added capability to live-patch configuration during runtime.
- Reworked and typed the `latest_frame` data structure, enabling reliable B-mode visualization.


## [1.1.0] - 2024-02-21

### Added

- An opportunity to turn on algorithm for optimizing HV MUX switching. As a result, the switching artifacts are minimized.
- Updated RX/TX API and Python GUI accordingly (optional tick box to activate optimal switching).
- A STOP button to stop acquisition earlier.
- A GUI to configure/save/load TX and RX configurations of the HV multiplexer.
- A GUI to configure ultrasound subsytem's parameters, +save them to or load them from a file.
- Comments/docstrings in the source files
- Added B-mode visualization option.
- The code in example jupyter notebook to load the data.

### Fixed

- Bug with empty COM port list (the GUI were failing when there were no COM ports in the system).
- Now the user can rerun the main GUI cell without closing the COM port first.

### Changed

- WULPUS stops acquisitions after GUI acquired required number of samples.
- User can now directly change the sampling frequency and not the oversampling ratio.
- Band-pass filter's max/min boundaries are dynamically adapted depending on the sampling frequency.
- All the time-related parameters are now configured in us (not ticks).
- PGA gain can now be selected from a drop-down list.
- Moved visualization to a separate thread.

### Removed
- Removed `./docs` folder with the old GUI guide. The information about the GUI is now available in the WULPUS user manual.
